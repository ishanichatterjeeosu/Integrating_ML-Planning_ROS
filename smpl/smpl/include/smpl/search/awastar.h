/// An implementation of the ARA* (Anytime Repairing A*) search algorithm. This
/// algorithm runs a series of weighted A* searches with decreasing bounds on
/// suboptimality to return the best solution found within a given time bound.
/// The search intelligently reuses its search tree between successive
/// iterations for improved efficiency, rather than starting each new
/// weighted-A* iteration from scratch.
///
/// This class maintains the state of the search procedure between calls to
/// replan(), allowing the search to resume from where it left off when the
/// scenario (start, goal, and edge costs in the graph) doesn't change between
/// calls. This can be used to dedicate more time to searching in the event the
/// search fails to find a solution within the given time and to allow solutions
/// to be returned quickly and allowing the search to continue improving the
/// solution given more time. To implement this, several assumptions about the
/// implementation of the graph and heuristic are made:
///
/// * The state IDs are constant between calls to replan(). If the state ID for
///   any state the search has encountered so far (via state expansions or
///   setting the start or goal) changes, the search will be invalid.
///
/// * Changes to the goal state are reflected by changes to the goal state ID.
///   Often, many graph representations that support multiple or underdefined
///   goal states will represent the goal state given to the planner using a
///   single goal state ID. If this is the case, the caller will have to assert
///   whether or not the goal has changed, and force the planner to reinitialize
///   by calls for force_planning_from_scratch (TODO: shouldn't require full
///   reinitialization)
///
/// * The heuristics for any encountered states remain constant, unless the goal
///   state ID has changed.
