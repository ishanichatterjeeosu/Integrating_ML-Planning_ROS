Because ndarrays are an unhashable type, the `.tobytes()` method is called on them, creating a byte representation. This technique is potentially brittle: it assumes that `grasps_contact_info` will not break the bitwise representation of the grasp transformation, which might not be the case with all versions of ContactGraspNet or all systems.
